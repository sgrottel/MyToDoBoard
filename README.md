## Companion Utilities
There are companion utilities for specific tasks.
They all operate on the same central [`.mytodo.yaml` data file](doc/mytodo-yaml.md) and are therefore fully compatible with each other.

### MyToDoReport
[MyToDoReport](./doc/mytodo-report.md) is a command line utility to read the `.mytodo.yaml` data file and to produce a report of it's content.

## Alternatives
If you look for a solution storing your data _online_, or _share_ between multiple people, or offer different views, or ..., or ..., or ..., then this might not be the app for you!
There are plenty of cloud-hosted or self-hosted alternatives on the internet.
Many offer free versions to try them out.
